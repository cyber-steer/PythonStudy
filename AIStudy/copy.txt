messiah  hwv        n    is an english language oratorio composed in      by george frideric handel  with a scriptural text compiled by charles jennens from the king james bible  and from the coverdale psalter  the version of the psalms included with the book of common prayer. it was first performed in dublin on    april      and received its london premiere nearly a year later. after an initially modest public reception  the oratorio gained in popularity  eventually becoming one of the best known and most frequently performed choral works in western music.

handel's reputation in england  where he had lived since       had been established through his compositions of italian opera. he turned to english oratorio in the    0s in response to changes in public taste; messiah was his sixth work in this genre. although its structure resembles that of opera  it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. instead  jennens's text is an extended reflection on jesus as the messiah called christ. the text begins in part i with prophecies by isaiah and others  and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds  the only "scene" taken from the gospels. in part ii  handel concentrates on the passion and ends with the hallelujah chorus. in part iii he covers the resurrection of the dead and christ's glorification in heaven.

handel wrote messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces  with optional settings for many of the individual numbers. in the years after his death  the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale  with giant orchestras and choirs. in other efforts to update it  its orchestration was revised and amplified  such as mozart's der messias. in the late  0th and early   st centuries the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to handel's original intentions  although "big messiah" productions continue to be mounted. a near complete version was issued on    rpm discs in     ; since then the work has been recorded many times.
